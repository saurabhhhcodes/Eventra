# Eventra API Documentation

## 📖 Prerequisites

Before working with the API, ensure your environment is properly configured:

**\u2705 [Environment Setup Guide](ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md)** – Complete configuration instructions including:
- Backend API URL configuration (`REACT_APP_API_URL`)
- Running the backend locally
- Troubleshooting connection issues
- Mock API vs real API modes

---

## Overview

Eventra provides a RESTful backend API built using Spring Boot and secured using JWT Authentication.

The APIs support:

- User authentication
- Event management
- Public and protected endpoint access
- Structured error handling
- Swagger/OpenAPI integration

**For detailed information on authentication flows, role-based access control, and how permissions work, see the [Architecture & Roles Guide](ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROLES.md#-route-protection--authentication-flow).**

---

# Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

## Production Swagger UI

```bash
https://eventra-backend-springboot-eybhdvaubxcua7ha.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net/swagger-ui/index.html
```

---

## Local Swagger UI

After starting the Spring Boot backend locally:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

If the backend runs on another port (example: `8081`), replace the port accordingly.

---

# Authentication Flow

Eventra uses JWT-based authentication.

## Step 1 — Register User

### Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/auth/signup
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "firstName": "john",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "confirmPassword": "password123"
}
```

---

## Step 2 — Login User

### Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/auth/login
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "usernameOrEmail": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

---

## Alternative: Google OAuth Login

### Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/auth/google
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "credential": "GOOGLE_ID_TOKEN_FROM_GOOGLE_OAUTH"
}
```

---

## Step 3 — Copy JWT Token

Successful login returns:

```json
{
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "john",
  "lastName": "doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "username": "john",
  "role": "CLIENT"
}
```

---

## Step 4 — Authorize Swagger

Click the **Authorize** button in Swagger UI and enter:

```bash
Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

Example:

```bash
Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

---

## Login

| Method | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| POST | `/api/auth/login` |

Authenticates the user and returns a JWT token.

### Request Body

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Request Body

None required.

### Successful Response (200)

```text
Logged out successfully

|--------|--------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | JWT token is missing, invalid, or expired |
| `404 Not Found` | Authenticated user could not be found |

#### Notes

- This endpoint is used to restore logged-in user/session state after refresh.
- The backend implementation is handled in the Eventra-Backend repository.

---

## Update User Profile

| Method | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|

### Event Response Note

Event create, update, and detail APIs return a sanitized event response object instead of the raw backend entity. The response includes public event fields such as `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `eventDate`, `capacity`, `registeredCount`, and `public`.

Internal backend fields such as registered user entities, attendee details, and JPA metadata are not exposed in event API responses.

## Create Event

| Method | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| POST | `/api/events/create` |

Creates a new event. This endpoint is restricted to authenticated users with `ORGANIZER` or `ADMIN` authority.


### Authentication

---

Requires a valid JWT token.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "title": "Manual Create Event Test",
  "description": "Testing event creation manually",
  "location": "Online",
  "eventDate": "2026-07-15T10:00:00",

- `eventDate` must be a future date/time.
- `capacity` is optional, but must be positive when provided.
- `isPublic` is optional and defaults to `true`.
- `registeredCount` is managed by the backend and defaults to `0`.

#### Success Response

```http
201 Created
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Manual Create Event Test",
  "description": "Testing event creation manually",
  "location": "Online",
  "eventDate": "2026-07-15T10:00:00",

- It prepares the backend for future real-time event broadcasts.
- *Note: Full real-time event create/update/register broadcasting is not yet implemented.*

### Response Media Type
`text/event-stream`

### Manual Test Command
```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8080/api/events/stream
```

# Common HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|----------|
| 200 | Successful request |
| 201 | Resource created successfully |
| 400 | Validation error / Bad request |
| 401 | Unauthorized |
| 403 | Forbidden |
| 404 | Resource not found |

# Frontend Integration Notes

Frontend applications should:

- Store JWT tokens securely
- Send tokens using the `Authorization` header
- Handle structured API error responses
- Use Swagger UI for endpoint testing during development

Example authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

---

# Benefits of Swagger Integration

- Interactive API testing
- Faster frontend-backend integration
- Better onboarding for contributors
- Centralized API reference
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Improved development workflow
